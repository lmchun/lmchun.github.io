<h3>Description</h3>
Collective Conscious was a passion project that I dreamt of over the summer of 2019. Without a strong connection and identity amongst local digital media artists, I wanted to create an exhibition that showcased not only the range of art and identities to come out of our community, but the potential that the future generation could bring. An exhibition produced through the CADRE Mentorship, a mentorship program aimed at bringing community amongst digital media artists in a time of uncertainty.<br>

With the theme of Dreams, each mentor and mentee pairings/trios collaborated on Digital Media art pieces to convey creations that hold meaning to them creatively, aesthetically, and with imagination. A creative and innovative program that helps build and bridge seniors to freshmen and transfers, this showcase is an opportunity for both the mentors and mentees to shine. Visit as digital citizens and enjoy viewing each piece as collaborative entities.
The images above are from our reception of our artists speaking about their pieces and views of the gallery on opening night. Images from artists, Catherine Thy Le, Eddson Jose, Alyssa Castaneda, Jason Manzon, Derek Kwok, Ashley Linder, and Deanna Gutierrez.
<br>

 Collective Conscious was my first foray into group virtual experience space and I am glad to have been able to see my dreams for the community come forward. 
I created the CADRE Mentorship with the help of my two friends Anthony Sokry and Sabrina Kwong to help me spearhead the program and to create change from the ground up. It has led to many new connections amongst new and old friends through previous alumni to new incoming students. 
Through the mentorship I created a space for digital media artist to feel at home and have a safe space to share ideas and work that are being prototyped and developed. As well as share opportunities to help us all succeed beyond the university and into our careers and life.
